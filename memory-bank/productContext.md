# Product Context

## Why This Exists
Manually converting a website into Webflow CMS structures is slow (8–20 hours). This app automates the process with AI analysis and exports.

## Problems It Solves
- Identifies repeatable UI components from real websites.
- Extracts semantic content models from HTML.
- Creates explicit bindings between data models and UI slots.
- Produces Webflow import assets (Collections, Symbols, Bindings, CSV).

## How It Should Work
- User signs in (email/password or Google).
- User enters a URL for analysis.
- The system scrapes the page and runs AI analysis.
- User reviews the output and exports.

## UX Goals
- Minimal setup to run a single analysis.
- Clear progress and results presentation.
- Reliable authentication and protected routes.
